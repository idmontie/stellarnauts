 `settings.example.js` is an example file of the settings that you will need.
 
 For example, at the time of writing this, the `settings.example.js` file looks like:
 
 ```
 Settings = {
  github: {
    key: "",
    secret: ""
  }
};
```

You should copy this file to `settings.js` and put your github key and secret in the file.
